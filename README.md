# User Feed Application

This Android application is designed to display a user feed on a single screen. The feed data is fetched from a remote API and stored locally using Room Database for offline access. Pagination is implemented using Paging3 library for smooth scrolling, and images are loaded using Coil library. The project follows MVVM Clean Architecture and uses Kotlin, Navigation Component, Hilt for dependency injection, and Jetpack Compose for UI.
